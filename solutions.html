        <h2>Student Carpool Matching</h2>
        <p>
            Many students feel hesitant to ask for rides in person, even if they know others nearby.
            Driver Buddy safely connects verified students for rides, building new friendships across campuses.
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature matches students based on route and schedule, using GPS and location services.
            Users enter their home address and destination campus, and the app suggests efficient matches.
            Students can confirm or decline the ride before finalizing, ensuring comfort and safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drivers can post weekly routes and times in advance, and the system suggests repeat matches.
            This reduces cars on the road, saves fuel, lowers congestion, and strengthens student connections.

        <h2>Affordable Subscription System</h2>
        <p>
            Students can choose monthly or annual subscriptions for unlimited rides instead of paying per trip.
            This provides reliable, budget-friendly commuting and ensures drivers have a steady flow of passengers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The subscription system makes commuting predictable and accessible while encouraging regular app usage.

        <h2>Verified Student Profiles</h2>
        <p>
            Safety is key. Users verify their identity with official school emails, and drivers submit insurance and license info.
            Background checks ensure only qualified drivers participate.
        </p>
        <p>
            In-app feedback lets riders rate experiences and vehicle cleanliness, building trust and accountability.
            Verified profiles foster a safe, reliable student community.

        <h2>Safety & Accident Response</h2>
        <p>
            The app includes an emergency report option to contact authorities, notify schools, and submit trip details in case of incidents.
        </p>
        <p>
            While early-stage coverage relies on personal insurance, future plans include partnerships with universities and local insurers to strengthen student protection.
