## Overview

Driver Buddy is a mobile application designed to help **college and university students** share rides, save money, and travel safely with verified peers. The app uses smart-matching, scheduling, and in-app communication to make student carpooling simple and reliable.

> Many students face challenges commuting between campuses or from off-campus locations: unreliable public transport, high ride costs, and wasted empty car seats. Driver Buddy connects students going the same way, making commuting affordable, safe, and social.


## The Problem

Students often face:  

* High transportation costs for rides and Uber/Lyft  
* Limited or unreliable public transportation  
* Wasted empty seats in cars  
* Difficulty coordinating rides with peers  
* Missed opportunities to connect with other students  

**Example scenario:**  
> Students living in Denton often rely on public transportation to get to Schol campus. Buses may not reach all neighborhoods, requiring extra travel. Driver Buddy connects verified students traveling the same routes, making commuting safer, cheaper, and more predictable.
