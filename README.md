# Driver Buddy – Student Carpooling App

## Overview

Driver Buddy is a mobile application designed to help **college and university students** share rides, save money, and travel safely with verified peers. The app uses smart-matching, scheduling, and in-app communication to make student carpooling simple and reliable.

> Many students face challenges commuting between campuses or from off-campus locations: unreliable public transport, high ride costs, and wasted empty car seats. Driver Buddy connects students going the same way, making commuting affordable, safe, and social.

## Features

### Student Carpool Matching

* Matches riders and drivers based on route similarity
* Considers preferred travel times
* Helps students connect who are going in the same direction
* Optional additional rider feature: if a student is within 15 minutes of campus, the driver can be notified and asked if they can pick up an extra rider

### Verified Student Profiles

* University email verification
* Driver background checks (insurance, no major accidents, no tickets)
* Ensures safety and trust
* Limits platform access to real students only

### Smart Scheduling

* Automatically suggests best ride times
* Detects scheduling conflicts
* Syncs with class schedules (optional)
* Sends notifications and reminders before each ride

### In-App Chat & Rating System

* Built-in messaging to coordinate pickup/drop-off
* Star rating system for drivers and riders
* Allows feedback on ride experience and vehicle cleanliness
* Option to report safety issues

### Eco-Friendly Incentives

* Earn “Green Points” for shared rides
* Track CO₂ and fuel saved
* Redeem points for campus discounts or coupons
* Encourages sustainable commuting habits

## The Problem
Students often face:
* High transportation costs for rides and Uber/Lyft
* Limited or unreliable public transportation, especially when switching campuses
* Wasted empty seats in cars
* Difficulty coordinating rides with peers
* Missed opportunities to connect with other students, especially international students

Example scenario:
> Students living in Denton often rely on public transportation to get to Schol campus. While buses are available, they do not reach all neighborhoods, and even the closest stops may require an additional ride. Some students need to travel between different parts of campus or nearby campuses, making transportation expensive, unreliable, or stressful, especially for last-minute trips. Driver Buddy helps students connect with verified peers traveling the same routes, making commuting safer, cheaper, and more predictable.

* Reliable, verified student carpooling
* Low-cost subscription options with automatic discounts for partner schools (NCTC, UNT, TWU)
